ls- Command used for listing

cat- reads the contents of a file, even if their aren't human readable

cd- Changes the directory i believe? Or just says what the current directory is? Honestly it could do both but documentation on command line commands is horrid.

find- finds a file in the current directory. Possibly able to search in sub directories but unclear if it can go up to parent directories. 

Commands to look into:

- Grep \( Useful to search i assume? Would help to learn and possibly has a similar vibe to regex \)
- Anything else not listed here because honestly it's sad how bad documentation is
