## Keynoard shortcuts
Shortcuts that I frequently use:
- Ctrl-C (Copy)
- Ctrl-V (Paste)
- Ctrl-X (Cut)
- Ctrl-Z (Undo)
- Ctrl-Shift-T (Open previously closed Tab in browser)
- Windows Key-Shift-S (Screenshot)

Shortcuts I would like to start using:
- Ctrl-A (select all) (I use this)
- Win-D (show desktop)
- Super-Hyper-Meta-F (Unlocks the secret to the universe. Just need to find the right keyboard)
- Shift (Too used to using Caps Lock to captalize stuff. Need to get into the habit of using Shift.
